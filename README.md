# HyUI

[Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md)

If you're not from CurseForge, here's the mod download:
[HyUI on CurseForge](https://curseforge.com/hytale/mods/hyui)

Make sure you include the project as a dependency on upload to CurseForge.


In the meanwhile, have you seen [Hytale UI Builder](https://hytale.ellie.au)?

I plan on extending it to support HyUI syntax.
